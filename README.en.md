## About the Project

In this repository, you can find the very simple HTML and CSS code of the website created to explain each laboratory practice of the Physics 1 and Basic Physics 2 courses taught in the second semester of 2020 by me. The designs presented on the website were made in Adobe Illustrator, and the respective SVG file provided by the program was modified to allow interaction with the elements of those designs.

## Usage

Just go to this [link](https://spoksonat.github.io/Laboratorios-Docencia/) to see the website.

## ToDo

1. Add the content of classes 5 and beyond for both courses.
2. Add the functionality of the "About Me" button, as it is not yet implemented.
